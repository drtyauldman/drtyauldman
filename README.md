I am an 85 y/o (used to be) dirty old man.  I wrote my first prpogram in 1959 and was amazed that i could get paid for having so much fun.
I incurred brain damage in 2020 and i am re-training my brain by writing a web app using html, javascript, and PHP.  I want to learn
node.js because PHP is not as enjoyable as javascript, eg 'explode' vs 'split'. I have written an app that runs on localhost using XAMPP 
as an interface tool. Now I want to replace the PHP with node.js and am having difficulty getting the pieces to work together.  I have 
NODE.JS installed, and am running Apache and Mysql witn XAMPP. When i copy and run a W3Schools demo "demo_db_connection.js" that has the
statement "var mysql = require('mysql');" I get a 'module not found message.  I believe it because i cant find it either! 

your advice is appreciated
